1.Initialize the variables:

left to represent the left pointer, starting at the beginning of the container (index 0).
right to represent the right pointer, starting at the end of the container (index height.size() - 1).
maxArea to keep track of the maximum area found, initially set to 0.
Enter a loop using the condition left < right, which means the pointers have not crossed each other yet.

2.Calculate the current area:

Use the min function to find the minimum height between the left and right pointers.
Multiply the minimum height by the width, which is the difference between the indices of the pointers: (right - left).
Store this value in the currentArea variable.

3.Update the maximum area:

Use the max function to compare the currentArea with the maxArea.
If the currentArea is greater than the maxArea, update maxArea with the currentArea.

4.Move the pointers inward: (Explained in detail below)

Check if the height at the left pointer is smaller than the height at the right pointer.
If so, increment the left pointer, moving it towards the center of the container.
Otherwise, decrement the right pointer, also moving it towards the center.

5.Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the pointers meet (left >= right), indicating that all possible containers have been explored.

6.Return the maxArea, which represents the maximum area encountered among all the containers.



If height[i] > height[j]:
This means that the height of the left container is greater than the height of the right container.
Moving the right pointer (j) would not increase the potential area because the height of the right container is the limiting factor.
So, to explore containers with the possibility of greater areas, we need to move the right pointer inward by decrementing j.

If height[i] <= height[j]:

This means that the height of the left container is less than or equal to the height of the right container.
Moving the left pointer (i) would not increase the potential area because the height of the left container is the limiting factor.
So, to explore containers with the possibility of greater areas, we need to move the left pointer inward by incrementing i.
